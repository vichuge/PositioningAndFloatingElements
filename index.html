                <p>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, with a new
                    son
                    and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing far
                    beyond the world of known physics.</p>
                <p>He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have been
                    created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with.
                    A
                    potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a
                    special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed
                    of
                    light for a prodigiously violent instant.</p>
                <p>If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from pole to
                    pole
                    and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and
                    irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit
                    in
                    the ocean.</p>
                <p>“SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double box around
                    it.</p>
                <p>On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the beginning
                    of
                    the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.</p>
                <p>Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to <a href="#">the first sliver of cosmic time</a> with
                    telescopes at the
                    South
                    Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics
                    detected ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called <a href="#">gravitational waves</a> — the
                    signature of a
                    universe being wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a
                    trillionth
                    of a second old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and
                    his
                    colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.</p>

                <p>
                    Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr. Guth,
                    wondered
                    whether it could ever be proved.
                </p>
                <p>If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the recent
                    discovery
                    of dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast realms of
                    time
                    and space and energy to science and speculation.</p>
                <p>Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years in space
                    with
                    its hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose
                    extent,
                    architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless
                    number
                    of other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.
                </p>
                <h2 class="bold-title">‘As Big as It Gets’</h2>
                <p>
                    In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating at energies forever beyond
                    the
                    reach of particle accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s
                    ripples
                    would be the first direct observation of gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory
                    of
                    general relativity, should ruffle space-time.
                </p>
                <p>Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert who was not part of the
                    team,
                    said, “This is huge, as big as it gets.”
                </p>
                <p> He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, sending a telegram encoded in
                    gravitational waves.”</p>
                <p>The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of microwave radiation that
                    permeates space and preserves a picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as
                    the
                    surface of the sun.</p>
                <p> Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as Bicep, for Background Imaging of
                    Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization, reported their results in a scientific briefing at the Center for
                    Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of papers submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.</p>
